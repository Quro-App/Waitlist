## ⚠️ Known Issue: OneDrive Path

Your project is in OneDrive with special characters in the path. This prevents local builds.

**Solutions:**
1. **Deploy to Vercel** (recommended) - Vercel builds it for you ✅
2. **Move project** to Desktop or Documents if you need local dev

To move:
```bash
cp -r "/Users/kayra/Library/CloudStorage/OneDrive-TheUniversityofSydney(Students)/Quro Waiting List Website" ~/Desktop/quro-waitlist
cd ~/Desktop/quro-waitlist
npm install
npm run dev
```
