## üîß Step-by-Step Setup

### Step 1: Create GitHub Repository

1. Go to https://github.com/Quro-App
2. Click **"New repository"** (green button)
3. Repository settings:
   - **Owner:** Quro-App
   - **Repository name:** `Waitlist`
   - **Description:** Professional waitlist page for Quro - Real-time barbershop wait times
   - **Visibility:** Public ‚úÖ
   - **Initialize:** ‚ö†Ô∏è **DO NOT** check "Add a README file" (we already have one)
   - **DO NOT** add .gitignore or license (we have these already)
4. Click **"Create repository"**

### Step 2: Push Your Code to GitHub

After creating the repository on GitHub, run these commands:

```bash
# Navigate to project directory
cd "/Users/kayra/Library/CloudStorage/OneDrive-TheUniversityofSydney(Students)/Quro Waiting List Website"

# Add all files (including your improvements)
git add -A

# Commit everything
git commit -m "Initial commit - Quro waitlist website with admin dashboard"

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

If it asks for credentials:
- **Username:** Your GitHub username (or Quro-App)
- **Password:** Use a **Personal Access Token** (not your GitHub password)

#### How to Create Personal Access Token:
1. Go to https://github.com/settings/tokens
2. Click "Generate new token (classic)"
3. Give it a name: "Quro Waitlist"
4. Select scopes: Check `repo` (all repo permissions)
5. Click "Generate token"
6. **Copy the token** (you won't see it again!)
7. Use this token as your password when pushing

### Step 3: Deploy to Vercel (Recommended)

Since you have the path issue, deploy directly to Vercel:

1. **Go to https://vercel.com**
2. Click **"Sign Up"** or **"Login"**
3. Choose **"Continue with GitHub"**
4. After connecting GitHub, click **"Add New Project"**
5. Import your repository:
   - Search for `Quro-App/Waitlist`
   - Click **"Import"**
6. Configure Project:
   - **Framework Preset:** Next.js (auto-detected)
   - **Root Directory:** `./`
   - **Build Command:** `npm run build` (default)
   - **Install Command:** `npm install` (default)
7. **Add Environment Variable:**
   - Click **"Environment Variables"**
   - Key: `ADMIN_PASSWORD`
   - Value: `Quro2025Launch!` (or create your own secure password)
   - Environment: Production ‚úÖ
8. Click **"Deploy"**

Vercel will build and deploy your site in ~2 minutes!

---

## üîë Your Admin Password

**Current Password:** `Quro2025Launch!`

This is stored in your `.env` file (local only, not pushed to GitHub).

**To change it:**
1. For local: Edit `.env` file
2. For production (Vercel): Update environment variable in Vercel dashboard

**‚ö†Ô∏è Security:** Change this to a stronger password for production!

---

## üåê After Deployment

Once Vercel finishes deploying, you'll get URLs like:

- **Production:** `https://waitlist-quro.vercel.app`
- **Admin Dashboard:** `https://waitlist-quro.vercel.app/admin`

### Test Your Website:

1. **Visit the landing page**
2. **Enter an email** to join waitlist
3. **Go to /admin**
4. **Enter your admin password:** `Quro2025Launch!`
5. **View your dashboard:**
   - Total signups
   - Total visitors
   - Email list
   - Export CSV

## üíª Local Development (After Fixing Path)

If you want to run locally, you need to fix the path issue:

### Option A: Move to Desktop
```bash
# Copy project to Desktop
cp -r "/Users/kayra/Library/CloudStorage/OneDrive-TheUniversityofSydney(Students)/Quro Waiting List Website" ~/Desktop/quro-waitlist

# Navigate to new location
cd ~/Desktop/quro-waitlist

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run development server
npm run dev
```

### Option B: Move to Documents
```bash
# Copy project to Documents
cp -r "/Users/kayra/Library/CloudStorage/OneDrive-TheUniversityofSydney(Students)/Quro Waiting List Website" ~/Documents/quro-waitlist

# Navigate to new location
cd ~/Documents/quro-waitlist

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run development server

## ‚öôÔ∏è API Endpoints Reference

Your website has these APIs:

| Endpoint | Method | Purpose | Auth Required |
|----------|--------|---------|---------------|
| `/api/subscribe` | POST | Add email to waitlist | No |
| `/api/track-visit` | POST | Track visitor | No |
| `/api/stats` | GET | Get public stats | No |
| `/api/admin/stats` | GET | Get admin dashboard data | Yes |

---

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### "Repository not found" on GitHub
- **Fix:** Make sure you created the repository on GitHub first
- Repository must be at: `https://github.com/Quro-App/Waitlist`

### "Permission denied" when pushing
- **Fix:** Use Personal Access Token instead of password
- Generate at: https://github.com/settings/tokens

### Website not loading
- **Fix:** Check Vercel deployment logs
- Make sure environment variable `ADMIN_PASSWORD` is set

### Admin password not working
- **Fix:** Check you set `ADMIN_PASSWORD` in Vercel environment variables
- Value should match what you use to login

### Database errors
- **Fix:** Vercel handles SQLite automatically, no action needed
- Database persists between deployments
