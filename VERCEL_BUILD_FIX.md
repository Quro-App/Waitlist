# Vercel Build Error Fix

## Issue

Vercel build was failing with this error:

```
Error in admin stats API: F [Error]: Route /api/admin/stats with `dynamic = "error"` 
couldn't be rendered statically because it accessed `request.headers`.
```

## Root Cause

Next.js 14 tries to statically generate API routes during build time by default. However, routes that:
- Access `request.headers`
- Access `request.json()`
- Read from a database
- Use dynamic data

...cannot be statically generated and must be rendered dynamically at runtime.

## Solution Applied

Added `export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic';` to all API routes that require runtime rendering.

### Files Fixed:

1. ✅ **`app/api/admin/stats/route.ts`**
   - Uses `request.headers.get('authorization')`
   - Needs dynamic rendering for authentication

2. ✅ **`app/api/subscribe/route.ts`**
   - Uses `request.json()` to parse body
   - Writes to database
   - Needs dynamic rendering

3. ✅ **`app/api/track-visit/route.ts`**
   - Uses `request.headers.get('x-forwarded-for')`
   - Uses `request.headers.get('user-agent')`
   - Writes to database
   - Needs dynamic rendering

4. ✅ **`app/api/stats/route.ts`**
   - Reads from database
   - Should be dynamic for real-time data

## Code Changes

Added this line at the top of each route file (after imports):

```typescript
// Force dynamic rendering for this route
export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic';
```

## Why This Works

- `dynamic = 'force-dynamic'` tells Next.js to **always** render this route at request time
- Prevents Next.js from trying to pre-render during build
- Ensures routes can access request headers, body, and dynamic data
- Required for API routes that interact with databases or use authentication

## Vercel Deployment

This fix ensures:
- ✅ Build completes successfully
- ✅ API routes work correctly at runtime
- ✅ Authentication headers are accessible
- ✅ Database operations work properly
- ✅ Real-time data is served (not stale static data)

## Alternative Approaches (Not Used)

We could have used:
- `export const dynamic = 'auto'` - Let Next.js decide (but might still fail)
- `export const revalidate = 0` - Disable caching (similar effect)
- Route segment config in `route.ts`

We chose `force-dynamic` because it's:
- ✅ Most explicit
- ✅ Most reliable
- ✅ Recommended for API routes with dynamic data
- ✅ Clear intent for other developers

## Testing

After this fix:
1. ✅ Vercel build should complete without errors
2. ✅ All API endpoints should work correctly
3. ✅ Admin authentication should function
4. ✅ Email signups should save to database
5. ✅ Visit tracking should work
6. ✅ Stats should show real-time data

## Next Steps

1. Commit these changes
2. Push to GitHub
3. Vercel will auto-deploy
4. Build should succeed ✅

## Additional Notes

### When to Use `force-dynamic`

Use for routes that:
- Access request headers or cookies
- Parse request body
- Read/write to database
- Fetch external APIs
- Use authentication
- Need real-time data

### When NOT to Use

Don't use for routes that:
- Return static data
- Can be cached indefinitely
- Don't need request context
- Benefit from CDN caching

For your waitlist app, ALL API routes need `force-dynamic` because they all interact with the database or request data.
